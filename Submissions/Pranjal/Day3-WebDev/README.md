# Day 3 – Web Development

This repository contains my **Day 3 Web Development submission** for the **Zeroes to Heroes – 10 Day Coding Challenge**.

In this task, I created a modern and responsive landing page using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The project focuses on clean UI design, proper folder structure, image handling, and basic interactivity like a progress bar and action buttons.

This challenge is helping me strengthen my fundamentals and build consistency through daily practice.
